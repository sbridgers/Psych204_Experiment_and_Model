\section{Introduction}

Teaching is one of the most powerful forms of human communication, enabling a rapid, effective dissemination of knowledge and culture within and across generations. Remarkably, we decide what information to teach without direct access to the learner's mind and often without explicit requests for information. How do we make this inference and how does this capacity develop? 

Consider a naive learner who encounters a novel toy and tries to figure out how it works via self-guided exploration. The learner likely has her own ideas about how the toy works and will test these hypotheses by intervening on the toy. However, this generation of evidence is costly, requiring time and effort. Additionally, the value of this exploration is uncertain as the learner might never successfully activate the toy. Teachers can help decrease the costs of learning by communicating information that would be too difficult, time-consuming, or perhaps even impossible to obtain on one's own. Likewise, teachers can increase the value of learning by providing the critical information needed to support the most accurate inference. Thus, an effective teacher should be sensitive to opportunities for maximizing the benefits of learning (the value of the information gained) and minimizing its costs (the effort needed to acquire it). However, neither the costs nor benefits of learning are directly observable; one must consider the learner's prior knowledge and goals, and reason forward in time to calculate the expected costs and benefits of learning.

Prior research suggests that even young children might be capable of such a sophisticated inference. Both infants and children expect agents to act in accordance with the principle of rationality -- i.e., that agents will act efficiently in pursuit of their goals \cite{Baker2009}. Looking time studies reveal that infants anticipate an agent to choose the action requiring the least amount of effort to achieve her goal \cite{Scott2013}. Preschool-aged children, like adults, go beyond simply reasoning about the overall utility of agents' goal-directed actions. Rather, they consider the relative costs and rewards of pursuing certain goals over others and make judgments consistent with a naive utility calculus, expecting agents to incur higher costs for greater rewards \cite{JaraEttinger2015}.

Relatedly, children and adults consider both the value and costs of information transfer when evaluating teachers, preferring teachers who provide enough evidence to support accurate inference over those who are exhaustively informative \cite{GweonReview, Shafto2012}. Likewise, children can decide how much information to teach given the learner's prior knowledge and goals and the costs of information transfer: If the learner has relevant prior knowledge, children are selective in how much they teach unless providing exhaustive information is no more costly (i.e., they are allowed to verbally explain how a toy works rather than needing to physically demonstrate it)  \cite{GweonSchulz2014}. Building upon this work, Bridgers and Gweon hypothesize that children (and adults) can flexibly decide what information to teach via an intuitive cost-benefit analysis. More specifically, they predict that children (5 to 7 years old) reason about the expected benefits and costs of learning on one's own (from the perspective of the learner), and successfully choose to teach information that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the costs. 

In a current experiment, Bridgers and Gweon are investigating whether children selectively teach information that decreases the expected costs of learning. In this study, children explore two novel toys. One toy has an obvious causal mechanism that is easy to discover and that produces an exciting effect (a single, red button that causes the toy to light-up and spin). The other toy has a non-obvious mechanism that is difficult to discover without instruction and that produces a relatively less interesting effect (two of seven buttons must be pressed simultaneously to make the toy play music). Once children learn how the toys work, they are asked to choose one to teach to a naive learner who will play with the toys later all by herself. Given children's sensitivity to differences in the costs of verbal communication and additional actions on a toy, Bridgers and Gweon predict children will reason about the expected costs of figuring out the toys on one's own vs. from instruction and will more often teach the difficult toy than the easy toy, but not in the control condition where each toy is equally easy to figure out.

Here, we formalize the intuitions Bridgers and Gweon investigate with a computational theory of efficient teaching. We develop a Bayesian cognitive model of a knowledgeable teacher reasoning about a naive learner who wants to figure out how two toys work. In this simplified scenario, the teacher selects one of two toys to teach the learner and the learner discovers how the other toy works on her own. We assume the teacher is helpful and that her goal is to teach the toy that will maximize the probability that the learner figures out how to activate both toys. The teacher, thus, critically bases her decision on the relative costs for the learner of figuring out how the toys work without instruction. 

In this paper, we first describe the details of the model and show that it predicts the teacher will teach the toy that has a higher cost of learning but when costs are equal, the toy with the higher value. Second, we compare the model's predictions to adult performance in an experiment based on Bridgers and Gweon's experiments with children. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the predictions of the model help us to better understand how we decide what to teach and how the model could be extended to incorporate the teacher's reasoning about her own costs and benefits of teaching to better account for the dyadic nature of pedagogical interactions.

\section{Model}

Central to our modeling approach are the ideas discussed in chapter 6 (Inference about inference) of Probabilistic Models of Cognition \cite{Goodman}. Our efficient teaching model merges the vending machine model and the teacher-learner model (both presented in chapter 6).  We modified the 'make-vending-machine' function to a 'make-toy' function: toys take a single action as an argument and return either an effect or nothing. Each possible action on a toy has a certain probability of producing the effect. Put simply, each toy has one or multiple buttons, and when pressed these buttons produce an outcome (e.g., something lights up) with high probability (90\%) or low probability (10\%). In the scenarios we consider, there are always two toys, which we will refer to as toy A and toy B.

The learner is represented as a function that takes in her goal (to activate both toys) and a message from the teacher about how one of the two toys works. Prior to receiving the teacher's message, the learner does not know how either of the toys works (expressed as not knowing the probability of effect associated with the possible actions on each toy).  As a result of the teacher's message, the learner knows how one toy works but does not know about the other toy and will need to figure it out on her own. We query the learner model for the actions she takes on toy A and toy B conditioning on her goal being satisfied (i.e., that she successfully activates the toys). The learner function thus returns the probability that the leaner will successfully activate both toys, $a$, given the message the teacher sends about one toy, $t$, and the learner's goal of activating both, $g_{learner}$ ($P_{learner}(a | t, g_{learner})$). 

According to predefined probabilities,  will represent toys as vending machines, we will represent cost as the uncertainty over what action will cause the toy to produce an outcome, and we will represent value as the quantity of that outcome. Conditioning on the teacher's and learner's goals, we will query the teacher model for which of the two toys the teacher selects to teach. We will conduct an experiment with adults to test the predictions of our model. Participants will be presented with several pairs of toys with varying learning costs and values (e.g., a toy that is easy to learn but high in value and a toy that is hard to learn but low in value), and participants will be asked to select the toy in each pair they think is more important to teach. Ideally, we will compare the predictions of our model against children's performance as well.

"Central to our understanding is the principle of rationality: an agent tends to choose actions that she expects to lead to outcomes that satisfy her goals. (This is a slight restatement of the principle as discussed in C. L. Baker, Saxe, and Tenenbaum (2009), building on earlier work by Dennett (1989), among others.) We can represent this in Church by a query?an agent infers an action which will lead to their goal being satisfied"

\red{one advantage of social learning is that is reduces the amount of data required for accurate inference?learner can make inductive inferences from small amounts of data In teaching, best to provide information that will lead to the most accurate inference (costly information is also potentially information the learner will never gain?too difficult, they won't persist long enough?minimizing cost is another way to maximize value?!) learners are sensitive to the cost of information transfer and additional demonstrations on a toy?can the reason about the expected costs of learning on your own vs. receiving instruction? causal learning, where a helpful teacher may significantly reduce the number of interventions required to learn latent causal structure; MOST INFORMATIVE BECAUSE REDUCES THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY}
